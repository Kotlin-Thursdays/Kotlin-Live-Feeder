## Background
This week we examine Kotlin and Spring Boot.  In the past, I've worked frontend for Spring JPA, but this is my first time working with pipelining a framework from the ground-up.  Spring's frameworks are widely used in the industry as the de-facto standard for web application development.  If there are any issue following this tutorial be sure to let the Kotlin Thursday team know!

We focus on Spring Boot, which needs very little spring configuration and offers project initializations from the website itself, and takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Spring Boot offers further neater features for quick start-up:

- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
- Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration


The aim for this segment is to create a personalized live-stream for Twitter updates from Kotlin sources as well as trackers for new Github releases on Kotlin libraries as well as issues being tracked on those libraries!
